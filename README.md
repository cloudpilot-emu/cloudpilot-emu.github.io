# About

Cloudpilot is a web-based emulator for PalmOS. It emulates dragonball based devices
and supports PalmOS up to version 4.x. Cloudpilot is based on the original POSE
emulator.

Currently, both Palm V and Palm m515 devices are supported. Cloudpilot can be run as
a web page or as a mobile app on phones and tables. The list of features includes

 * Realistic emulation of timers and device speed
 * Continuous state saves --- emulation resumes if the page or app is reloaded
 * Direct installation of .prc and .pdb files
 * Export and import snapshot files
 * Switching between multiple emulation sessions
 * Audio emulation
 * Keyboard input
