The "Settings" tab allows you to configure Cloudpilot.

# Settings

### Volume

This setting control the volume of the emulated audio. Setting the volume to zero
disables audio.

### Run when hidden

Keep Cloudpilot running when its browser tab is hidden. Note that this does not
keep Cloudpilot running on mobile if the browser or homescreen app is
backgrounded.

### Clipboard integration (supported browser only)

This turns on clipboard integration. This option is only available on browsers that
support it. Notably, this option is not available on Firefox.

### Network redirection

Cloudpilot can connect the virtual PalmOS device to the network via
a proxy server. This configuration supports network hotsync. Please check the
[online documentation](https://github.com/cloudpilot-emu/cloudpilot/blob/master/doc/networking.md)
for detailed instructions.

If you enable network redirection you'll have to enter the address of the proxy
server below. Use the "Test" button to test the connection before attempting to
connect from within the virtual device.


### Auto-lock UI

This setting causes the navigation to automatically hide when the emulated devices
launches on startup.

### Show Statistics

This overlays the grafitti area with a collection of performance statistics.
