The card file explorer allows you to manage the contents of your virtual memory
cards.

# Information about Palm OS and file locations

Palm OS was extended in version 4.0 with support for expansion cards. when a
card is inserted, a new 'category' will appear on the Palm OS launcher (home
screen) with the name of the card.

Palm OS looks for files in very specific locations:
* /Palm/Launcher -- any PRC or PDB files that are placed in this location will
  appear in the Palm OS launcher when the card category is selected.
* /Palm/Programs -- most programs that enable users to store data on an
  expansion card will create their own folder in this location.
* /DCIM/ -- this is the location where digital camera images are typically saved
  to, and as a result, most image browser programs will look in this location
  for photos and media.


# Adding Files

To add a file to the card there are two options:
f
* First bring up the contextual menu (three dots), and choose 'Add file'.
* Alternatively, you can also drag-and-drop individual files into the card
  window.

Folders cannot be added this way. Instead, zip the folder and then unzip it to
the card (see below).

# Working with Files & Folders

The contextual menu provides a number of options for working with files on the
virtual card. You can access the main contextual via the three dots in the top
right corner of the card window

The features available in the main contextual menu are:

* Start selection - start selecting multiple files
* Add files - add file(s) to the card
* Add directory - create a new folder on the card
* Extract zip - extract a zip file to the card
* Paste - paste file and folder from the clipboard
* Help - open this help page

There are also a number of contextual options available for individual files and
folders. The individual contextual menu can be accessed in two ways:

* On desktop: by right clicking on a file in the file explorer.
* On mobile: by swiping on a file from left-to-right or right-to-left to see
  different options.

The options available for individual files and folders are:

* Edit - rename the file or folder's, or change its attributes (read-only,
  hidden, system)
* Save - download the file to your host machine
* Copy / Cut - copy or cut the file to the clipboard
* Delete - delete the file or folder

# File Attributes

Every file and folder on a virtual card has three file attributes:

* Read-only Flag - file cannot be modified
* Hidden Flag - file is not visible in the file explorer on Palm OS.
* System Flag - this file is a system file

These attributes can be viewed in the main file list as icons on the right side
of the file listing panel.

**Please note**: these flags are not respected in the file explorer, and it is
still possible to modify or delete files with the read-only flag set.

To modify these attributes, bring up the file edit panel:

 * On desktop: Right click on the file in the file explorer, and choose 'edit'.
 * On mobile: Swipe from right to left on the file, and choose the blue 'edit'
   button.
