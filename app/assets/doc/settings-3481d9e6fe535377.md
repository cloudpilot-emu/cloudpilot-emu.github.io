### Clipboard integration

### Network redirection

:::div{.feature-native-network}
CloudpilotEmu can connect the virtual PalmOS device to the network.

If you set "Redirection method" to "Native", CloudpilotEmu will connect PalmOS
directly to your network. Please note that iOS will ask for your consent if
you try to access the local network, i.e. if you are trying to HotSync with
a server on your local network. This setting can be changed at any later point in
the "Settings" app (navigate to Apps -> CloudpilotEmu).

If you set "Redirection method" to "Proxy", CloudpilotEmu will connect to the
network using a proxy server. In this mode you'll have to enter the address of the proxy
server below. Use the "Test" button to test the connection before attempting to
connect from within the virtual device. Please check the
[online documentation](https://github.com/cloudpilot-emu/cloudpilot-emu/blob/master/doc/networking.md)
for detailed instructions on setting up the proxy.

launches on startup.

### Show Statistics

This overlays the grafitti area with a collection of performance statistics.

### Open from remote sources

Enabling this will allow you to load ROMs, session images and install files
from remote URLs. Please note that those will have to be served via HTTPS
(unless you are hosting CloudpilotEmu yourself via HTTP), and the file server
has to support CORS.

:::div{.feature-indicator-fix}
### Fix iOS home indicator (iOS Safari only)

Safari on iOS has a glitch that may display the home indicator (the white-ish bar
at the bottom of the screen) on top of the UI instead below it. Whether you are
affected depends on how the toolbar is configured in the Safari settings. This
is cannot be detected, but you can change this setting in order to work around
the issue if you are affected.
