# Version 1.7.13

This release changes the way `cloudpilot-server` generates its certificates. The
new setup generates both a root and a leaf certificate and has much better
compatibility with various browser / OS combinations. In particular, Firefox
and recent versions of Chrome reject the self-signed certificate that was
previously generated, but work fine with the new setup. You can continue to use your
current certificates as long as they work, but check out the online
[networking documentation](https://github.com/cloudpilot-emu/cloudpilot-emu/blob/master/doc/networking.md)
in order to generate new certificates.

    certificate.
