# Privacy statement

CloudpilotEmu is a strictly client side application. It stores the data that you enter
locally on your device and does not transmit any of it over the network.

If you choose to use network integration CloudpilotEmu will open a connection to
the network proxy and transmit any data that is sent by the virtual device to the
proxy. The proxy is only provided in source by the project, and you yourself are
responsible for operating it and for applying any policies to the data
that is transmitted.

CloudpilotEmu is hosted on Github Pages and does not use any web tracking services.
According to their own documentation, Github Pages will record and store your IP address
when you visit the site. Please check Githubs own
[documentation on github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
and Githubs
